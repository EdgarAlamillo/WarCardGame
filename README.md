# WarCardGame
This is my Final project for my CIS18A Java objects programing course. This program is based on casino war card game created using JDK 21 on Eclipse IDE It allows you to
play casino war and wager in each round with out having to use real money. 

Features you playing against the dealer using a 52 card deck. It allows you to wager each round and cash out after each round. Outside of not having 312 cards (6 Decks) it follows the casino rules. Program also contains menu selection at the begining and when cashing out will give you how much money won or lost with also the outcome of each round. This program also tries its best to account for any user input errors.

Explanation on how to play: The goal of the game is to have a higher card than your opponent. The rankings start at the lowest of 2 and go all the way up to the highest ace. Each player draws one card. The highest card is the winner of that round and takes the losers card. If anyone loses all their cards then they have offically lost the game. If a tie happens then war starts.Each player must put down an additional card if they go to war or may surrender to keep half their wager. Winner takes all cards.
